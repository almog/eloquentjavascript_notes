## Using functions as namespaces
  * Why did he jumped straight from function declaration to function expression as  way to create a scope (dayName)?
  * Use paretheses to help JS interpreters tell a function declaration from a function expression.

## Evaluating data as code
  * Eval injects code into the _current scope_
  * The function constructor takes a textual (string) list of parameter and the function body.


## Require
  * Why was it good to pass both `exports` _and_ `module` rather than just module (which has the `exports`) as a property?

## Slow Loading modules
  * AMD - Asynchronous Module Definition
